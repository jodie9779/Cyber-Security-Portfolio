# Cyber-Security-Portfolio

This portfolio will contain write-ups from labs which I complete whilst self-learning penetration testing and other cyber security methodology. 

## TryHackMe

TryHackMe is a free online platform which uses exercises and labs to teach cyber security. Whilst TryHackMe offers a free plan, there is also a paid plan which allows access to more labs and training plans. Labs often contain tasks, which when completed gives a flag. The writeup for each lab will not contain the full flag.
